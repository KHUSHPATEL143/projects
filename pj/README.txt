PJ Shoots — Design package
=========================

Files included:
- index.html          -> Full responsive HTML prototype (desktop/tablet/mobile friendly)
- styles.css          -> CSS used by index.html
- logo.svg            -> Simple SVG logo used in header
- figma_import.json   -> Project/frame descriptor to help import structure into Figma
- README.txt          -> This file

How to use:
1) Open index.html in your browser to preview the responsive prototype.
2) To get this into Figma:
   Option A (recommended): Use a plugin like 'HTML to Figma' or 'Import to Figma' which can convert HTML/CSS into Figma layers.
   Option B: Open Figma, create a new file, then copy elements manually using the HTML preview as a visual guide. The 'figma_import.json' lists frame names and sizes to speed up layout.
3) All images are inline SVG placeholders — replace them with real photos by editing the <img> src in index.html or swapping logo.svg.

Notes:
- This package was auto-generated as a ready-to-import prototype. If you need a .fig file specifically, I can provide detailed steps to convert this HTML into a Figma file using free plugins or, if you prefer, guide you through building it directly inside your Figma account.
